`《思夏村》`

一别夏村久，思绪总难平。

云飘蓝天渺，鱼跃靛湖清。

晨起红雀躁，晚来青蛙鸣。

教堂巡远近，福音传古今。

心静逸思远，眼阔道德明。

今生再难见，何处了别情。

`Missing Charlotte`

It's such a long time since said farewell to Charlotte city

Miss waves can't stay still

I can remember the floating clouds made blue sky even higher

The jumping fish made dark lake even clearer

Red birds sang in the morning

And green toads made noise in the evening

The church shows it's influence to the community

The gospel has guided people along the history

My mind was free because of the peaceful heart

The Word was understood because of my opened eyes

There may not have an opportunity for me to revisit the Queen City

I'm wondering, then, where can I put my miss on any?
