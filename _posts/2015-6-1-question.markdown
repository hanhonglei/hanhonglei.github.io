## Steps to set up personal blog website in Github

Install Jekyll and related environments follow the instruction strictly [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

Before finally call build function of Jekyll, you should follow these steps to let it run successfully on Windows system.


1. Add your repository name with organization to your **_config.yml**, like: repository: henry/henrydf.github.io. See it from [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4705)

2. About "GitHub Metadata warning", you should follow these steps as describe in [this site](https://www.hieule.info/programming/fix-errors-github-metadata-ssl-certificate-running-jekyll-serve/):

	2.1 GitHub Metadata is a gem required by Jekyll. We need a GitHub personal token to make it work. Follow the excellent guide on GitHub to create a token, copy it to a safe place.
Now, create new environment variable in your system named `JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN` with the value pasted from the created token. 

	2.2 Now, down load the .pem file from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem). Then, create another environment variable called `SSL_CERT_FILE` pointing to the location of downloaded .pem file.

## Create contents of the blog website

The Github pages blog system is heavily based on the Github repository. Any new posted posts should be placed in _posts folder, and give a specific file name date `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown`.

Any posted articles will be automatically updated by Github pages after you push them to your Github repository.

## Grab particular posts in the blog website

If you want to collect some particular posts in a page, code work wouldnâ€™t be avoided.
The code below will collect all posts have category type poem, and the post date will also be rendered:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
<ul>
	{% for post in site.posts %} 
		{% if post.categories contains 'poem' %}
		<li>
			<a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
			<span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span>
			{{ post.excerpt }}
		</li>
		{% endif %} 
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Keep update of the resource
You should always update functions to keep your Jekyll resources up to date.

If you followed our setup recommendations and installed Bundler, run `bundle update github-pages` or simply `bundle update` and all your gems will update to the latest versions.

If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem update github-pages`
