## 3.	[A demo using Leapmotion in VR environment](https://bitbucket.org/Honglei_Han/leapmotioncontrolvrdemo)

A tower defense game in VR environment using Leapmotion as the interactive method.

There are two methods to play this game. One is traditional method, using keyboard and mouse. The other one is using VR glasses and leap motion hand controller.

## 4.	[Lottery](https://github.com/hanhonglei/Lottery) 

Use Microsoft MFC, and use skin to beautify. Can generate the lucky numbers randomly.

## 5.	[MyPHDProject](https://github.com/hanhonglei/PHDProject)

Used in Honglei Han's PHD study and graducation. Please check the readme.doc for more details.

## 6. [Samples of my book Game Development Programming Foundation](https://github.com/hanhonglei/GameDevelopmentSamples)

Samples of all chapters in the book `Game Development Programming Foundation`

They are all programmed using `C/C++` language, and built successfully in `Microsoft Visual Studio 2010` using `Win32` framwork.

In some PC that never installed `Visual Studio`, may require Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555).

Usage:

You can open all samples in the `Visual Studio` project named `GameDevelopmentHan`, or you can open them separately from their own folders using `Visual Studio`.

More information please check from the book [here](http://product.dangdang.com/23951820.html), or [here](http://www.cuc.edu.cn/cgzt/5564.html).

## 7. [User Study of the Paper Implicit measures of user attention in virtual environment navigation](https://github.com/hanhonglei/UserAttentionUserStudy)

User Study of the Paper [Implicit measures of user attention in virtual environment navigation](https://hanhonglei.github.io/publications/)

`Abstract`: The eye-tracker device is the main tool to obtain visual attention. However, it is hard to be applied in the 3D virtual scene navigatipron because of its poor reliability, great complexity and high price. We propose a new attention measure metric which can be easily embedded in the virtual environment. Behaviors of virtual camera controlled by the user are regarded as implicit expression of visual attention. The implicit expression is parameterized by the observed object’s distance to the center of the camera, occlusion, projected area, and observation time. A sophisticated user study experiment is designed to verify the reliability of this kind of measurement. The proposed implicit measurement of user attention can be effectively applied to an application of user attention aided game design.

This is the user study `Unity 3D` application of [this paper](http://info.scichina.com:8084/sciF/CN/Y2014/V44/I11/1398).

During user navigating, all attention evulation parameters, proposed in this paper, of different saliency game object will be recorded in different files located in folder `Output`. The player navigate behavior will be recorded as well.

After collect enough samples, an user attention measure result of different saliency level game object will be obtained.
